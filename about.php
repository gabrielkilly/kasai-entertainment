    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
    <div>
      <p>In 2016, Ray and Lisa Thomas Owners of Kasai Entertainment had one simple idea – to provide the greatest, magical moments using cutting-edge sound and lighting equipment. Kasai Entertainment has strived to increase its range of quality products that can add a personal touch to any event. Using the latest cutting-edge hardware and software technologies, the team is constantly introducing new products to add to the range – with an emphasis on quality over quantity.   Our goal is to provide a creative platform for our client’s events; and the company’s growth over the years shows our success in doing just that.

      <h2>RAY THOMAS</h2>
      <p>
        Being a DJ might be one of the best professions in the world. You get to listen to music all of the time, then get to play what you feel to a crowd of people. Ray Thomas (DJ Kasai) with experience in the profession for 10 years, has always had a deep passion for music. People listen to music for two reasons, the first is because they like the personality of that person and the other side is that they hear the music and they just love it. I always strive to be the entertainer that provides both. Whether I’m partying on stage with you as a DJ or I’m really enjoying the sounds I produce, what’s important is that we’re both enjoying it together sharing the experience together.
